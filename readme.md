This is a github repository for [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com)'s weekly web dev challenge where you can test all your HTML, CSS, JavaScript and UI Design skills and win rewards!

Even better, we display all your amazing solutions on our [submissions site](https://weeklywebdevchallenge.scrimba.com/) so you can show off your skills and be inspired by fellow Scrimba students as well!

Plus we hold a weekly live stream [over on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Scrimba) where we check out your awesome solutions and give away cool Scrimba swag and subscriptions!

If you want to contribute to this project make sure to read [contributing.md](contributing.md) first.
