# Happy Hacktoberfest with Screamba! 🎃👻

We are [so excited](https://giphy.com/clips/studiosoriginals-reaction-excited-emotion-BYGf5pxcA18gQRWaFt) that you're here! 💫

Here's how to contribute to the Weekly Web Dev Challenge submissions page! 👀

1. Click on the **Issues** tab to see a list of features we'd like for the page - the ones with an assignee are already taken by other people. 
2. Choose an issue you'd like to tackle. 
3. Add a comment saying that you'd like to do it. **Wait for Leanne to confirm**.
4. When Leanne gives the green light 🚦, clone the repository, create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`, get coding! 💻
5. When finished, push to your branch and submit a pull request. Wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged! ✨

**⚠️ Please keep these things in mind to increase the chances of your pull request being accepted:** 

- Please keep any styling as close as possible to that on the scrimba.com site, e.g: fonts, colors, buttons. 🎨
- Keep your change as focused as possible - just tackle the issue you've been assigned to. 🎯
- Write a good commit message to explain what you've done. 📝 So not `git commit -m "fixes"` 😆

**Lastly, please remember that approved contributions will be live on the submissions page, which means that they will be public.**

## FAQs

**Q: Can I do something which hasn't been raised as an issue?** 💡

A: Quite likely yes, but please raise an issue first and wait for Leanne to approve (this will also help for it to count towards your Hacktoberfest goal). Please check first that your issue hasn't already been asked by using the search feature and give a descriptive title and thorough description. 

**Q: Will this count towards my Hacktoberfest goal? 🎃**

A: If your pull request is approved and it's October, we *think* it will count - but we're Hacktoberfest noobs, so we're learning together. 🧑‍🎓

**Q: Can I do more than one issue?** 🤔

A: If you complete an issue, you're welcome to take another, but we ask that you only take one at a time to give as many people as possible a chance to get involved. 

**Q: Where can I ask another question?**

A: Head over to [Scrimba's Discord server](https://discord.gg/scrimba) and either ask in the *#🎃Hacktoberfest* channel or drop a message to **Leanne from Scrimba**. Alternatively, you can contact [Leanne on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RybaLeanne).
